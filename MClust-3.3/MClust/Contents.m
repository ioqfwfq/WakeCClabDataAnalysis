Some functions will require the statistical toolbox as well% (available from MathWorks).  MClust-3.0 has been tested on PC workstations running % Windows 95 (Microsoft), Windows NT (Microsoft), and Windows 2000 (Microsoft).  But should% be easily portable to other platforms.  [If you do such a port, please contact me and I will% make them publicly available with appropriate credit.  - adr]%% MClust reads neural recording data (see LoadingEngines).  % It ouputs "t-files", which contain (after a header) a list% of timestamps in binary format.  Timestamps are 32-bit longs at a resolution% of 10 timestamps/ms.  It is supplied with a Loading Engine capable of reading Cheetah TT files.% Nothing has to be done to the files in order to load them into MClust.  Other Engines may% soon be available.%% From the matlab prompt, make sure that the MClust directory is in your matlab path.% Then type "MClust" at the matlab prompt.  Running MClust will open a matlab window.  % -------------------------------------------------------------------% VERSION CONTROL% May 2002 ADR Version 3.00 released.% August 2003 ADR Version 3.20 released%  3.2.1 - fixed text in cover%        - updated Wavecutter (SCowen)%  [3.2.2] %        - Moved feature_waveFFT and feature_valley into Features directory%        because they are used by standard batch processing file%        - capitalizations fixed to improve linux port
